/*
### Individual Bonus Rules

- Those who have a rating of a 2 or below should not receive a bonus.
- Those who have a rating of a 3 should receive a base bonus of 4% of their base annual income.
- Those who have a rating of a 4 should receive a base bonus of 6% of their base annual income.
- Those who have a rating of a 5 should receive a base bonus of 10% of their base annual income.
- If their employee number is 4 digits long, this means they have been with the company for longer than 15 years,
and should receive an additional 5%.
- However, if their annual income is greater than $65,000, they should have their bonus adjusted down 1%.
- No bonus can be above 13% or below 0% total.


## The Bonus Calculation Function

Write a declared function that takes in one **Employee** object (as an argument to the function), and `return` a new **object** with the following properties. _Note these properties are different than the ones you start with!_

* The `name` property should contain the employee's name.
* The `bonusPercentage` property should contain the bonus percentage the employee is to receive. See section below for calculation instructions.
* The `totalCompensation` property should be the adjusted annual compensation (base annual + bonus)
* The `totalBonus` should be the employee's total bonus rounded to the nearest dollar.
